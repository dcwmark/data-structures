data-structures
===============


This work does NOT contain any original concept or idea.  This is my node.js study guide.

While code implementation of these concepts and ideas are NOT copy-paste of other's work, concepts and ideas are not new nor original, neither.  It does reflect my limited understanding of the language and looking for ways for impovement.

npm -g install jasmine
npm -g install jasmine-node


cd <workspace>/data-structure && jasmine-node . --autotest
